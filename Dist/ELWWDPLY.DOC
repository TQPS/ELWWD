-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-[2-Overview of Player Stats. Introduction-2]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     Strength(STR) 
       Strength is the raw physical power of a character. It is most  
       important in combat, as it provides added accuracy and damage 
       to a weapons abilities.

     Dexterity(DEX)
       Dexterity is the nimbleness and agility of a character. It is
       also important in combat, as it increases the players Armor 
       Class.

     Constitution(CON)
       Constitution is the healthiness and disease resistance of a 
       character. A high score in this area is desirable for all classes,
       since it gives bonuses to Hit Points and Aging.  
       
     Wisdom(WIS)
       Wisdom is a character's judgment, willpower, and enlightenment. 
       It is of importance mainly to characters  who can wield priest
       spells, as it gives bonus to their casting ability.

     Intelligence(INT)
       Intelligence is a character's memory and learning ability. It is
       of importance mainly to characters  who can wield Mage spells, 
       as it gives bonus to their casting ability.

     Charisma(CHR)
       Charisma is a character's charm, wit or appearance. Charisma does  
       not affect any one class but instead affects all the NPC's a player
       meets in the game. (i.e. Shopkeepers)

     Luck(LCK)
       Luck is simply a characters good fortune, or ability to outwit the
       odds. High luck is desirable in all characters. After all, it may 
       come in handy when your fighting a 10th level Death Dragon, eh?

     Hitpoints(HP)
        Simply put hitpoints are a players life. When they reach zero your
        character dies.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-[3-Races In-depth-3]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Humans
  Humans are mortals of the earthen plane. In Worlds of Darkness humans are 
  the basis for comparison to all other races. As a result of this they have
  no penalties or bonuses for their attributes. They also posses a good 
  casting ability, making them a good choice for any profession or class.

Dwarves
  Dwarves appear to be short and stocky humans who spend much of their time
  underground mining. Due to their lifestyle dwarves have increased strength
  and constitution, although their dexterity suffers from the enclosed spaces
  of mine shafts. Their extended exposure to the Earth Spirits also grants 
  them a resistance to earth based spells.  However their ability to cast 
  spells is limited.  Dwarves make good warriors for any party without 
  suffering from many penalties.

Elves
  Elves are woodland creatures that resemble tall and elegant humans. They
  are communion with the forest and it's energies giving them an above 
  average casting ability plus magic resistance, making them good enchanters,
  seers, or rangers.

Dark Elves
  Dark Elves are the evil twins of elves. Living in massive underground 
  cities dark elves have separated them selves from their woodland kin. No
  matter how separated from their kin dark elves have excellent magic 
  resistance and casting ability. However, the dark elf society is one of 
  evil and due to this tradition dark elves have very poor charisma.

Haflings
  Haflings are very short and squat. They generally live underground and 
  have exceptional dexterity and luck, although their strength could use
  a little improvement.

Bazzars
  Bazzars usually wear long hooded robes covering their physical appearance.
  This is largely because Bazzars are beings of pure magical energy and have
  no physical body. As a result of their magical nature they posses excellent
  magic resistance and tremendous casting ability, making them a great choice
  for an enchanter or seer class. The only drawbacks of all this magical 
  might is that there is little development of the body making them poor
  warriors.

Drakken 
  Drakken are a race of 'Dragon People' whose origin can be traced back to
  the experiments of a mad geomancer. Standing taller than an average human
  Drakken are covered in scales with a crest of horns in the head area.
  Drakken are very strong and have an incredible resistance to fire and some
  magic's. Besides this the Drakken have no great drawbacks in any one area
  making them a good selection for any class.

Covenanters
  Covenanters are a distant branch of the Drakken. Physically Covenanters are
  only about four feet tall and are usually covered with black scales. Their
  heads are adorned with horns much like a Drakken except their horns are 
  shorter. Covenanters usually live in Arctic regions due to the isolation.
  They desire this isolation due to their monk-like nature. Covenanters 
  constantly study scrolls and record information of importance to the 
  cleansing of the realms sins. Because of this extreme piety Covenanters make
  excellent Acolytes or Seers, although their performance in other areas 
  lacks.

Firmyr
  Firmyr are a race of giant wolf-like creatures. Standing approximately ten
  feet tall and weighing about half a ton Firmyr posses tremendous strength 
  and constitution.  This raw power and savagery make Firmyr the ideal choice
  for a warrior. Other than this Firmyr society is very tribal leading them
  to be vary wary of magic's and arcane knowledge.

  a high level monster. Kensai have access to object classes A,B, and E.

  minor powers in both the acolyte and enchanter realms, while remaining a 
  better fighter than either. Dark Lords also have access to ALL object 
  classes EXCEPT the Kensai artifacts.
