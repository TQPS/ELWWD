## WHAT IS WORLDS OF DARKNESS?

 Worlds of Darkness is an unfinished and unreleased ANSI 3-D role playing game.
 During the course of the game many races, classes, and items can be found
 throughout the game world. 

## PLAYER STATS

 Strength(STR) 
   Strength is the raw physical power of a character. It is most  
   important in combat, as it provides added accuracy and damage 
   to a weapons abilities.

 Dexterity(DEX)
   Dexterity is the nimbleness and agility of a character. It is
   also important in combat, as it increases the players Armor 
   Class.

 Constitution(CON)
   Constitution is the healthiness and disease resistance of a 
   character. A high score in this area is desirable for all classes,
   since it gives bonuses to Hit Points and Aging.  
   
 Wisdom(WIS)
   Wisdom is a character's judgment, willpower, and enlightenment. 
   It is of importance mainly to characters  who can wield priest
   spells, as it gives bonus to their casting ability.

 Intelligence(INT)
   Intelligence is a character's memory and learning ability. It is
   of importance mainly to characters  who can wield Mage spells, 
   as it gives bonus to their casting ability.

 Charisma(CHR)
   Charisma is a character's charm, wit or appearance. Charisma does  
   not affect any one class but instead affects all the NPC's a player
   meets in the game. (i.e. Shopkeepers)

 Luck(LCK)
   Luck is simply a characters good fortune, or ability to outwit the
   odds. High luck is desirable in all characters. After all, it may 
   come in handy when your fighting a 10th level Death Dragon, eh?

 Hitpoints(HP)
    Simply put hitpoints are a players life. When they reach zero your
    character dies.

## RACES

 Humans
   Humans are mortals of the earthen plane. In Worlds of Darkness humans are 
   the basis for comparison to all other races. As a result of this they have
   no penalties or bonuses for their attributes. They also posses a good 
   casting ability, making them a good choice for any profession or class.
 
 Dwarves
   Dwarves appear to be short and stocky humans who spend much of their time
   underground mining. Due to their lifestyle dwarves have increased strength
   and constitution, although their dexterity suffers from the enclosed spaces
   of mine shafts. Their extended exposure to the Earth Spirits also grants 
   them a resistance to earth based spells.  However their ability to cast 
   spells is limited.  Dwarves make good warriors for any party without 
   suffering from many penalties.
 
 Elves
   Elves are woodland creatures that resemble tall and elegant humans. They
   are communion with the forest and it's energies giving them an above 
   average casting ability plus magic resistance, making them good enchanters,
   seers, or rangers.
 
 Dark Elves
   Dark Elves are the evil twins of elves. Living in massive underground 
   cities dark elves have separated them selves from their woodland kin. No
   matter how separated from their kin dark elves have excellent magic 
   resistance and casting ability. However, the dark elf society is one of 
   evil and due to this tradition dark elves have very poor charisma.
 
 Haflings
   Haflings are very short and squat. They generally live underground and 
   have exceptional dexterity and luck, although their strength could use
   a little improvement.
 
 Bazzars
   Bazzars usually wear long hooded robes covering their physical appearance.
   This is largely because Bazzars are beings of pure magical energy and have
   no physical body. As a result of their magical nature they posses excellent
   magic resistance and tremendous casting ability, making them a great choice
   for an enchanter or seer class. The only drawbacks of all this magical 
   might is that there is little development of the body making them poor
   warriors.
 
 Drakken 
   Drakken are a race of 'Dragon People' whose origin can be traced back to
   the experiments of a mad geomancer. Standing taller than an average human
   Drakken are covered in scales with a crest of horns in the head area.
   Drakken are very strong and have an incredible resistance to fire and some
   magic's. Besides this the Drakken have no great drawbacks in any one area
   making them a good selection for any class.
 
 Covenanters
   Covenanters are a distant branch of the Drakken. Physically Covenanters are
   only about four feet tall and are usually covered with black scales. Their
   heads are adorned with horns much like a Drakken except their horns are 
   shorter. Covenanters usually live in Arctic regions due to the isolation.
   They desire this isolation due to their monk-like nature. Covenanters 
   constantly study scrolls and record information of importance to the 
   cleansing of the realms sins. Because of this extreme piety Covenanters make
   excellent Acolytes or Seers, although their performance in other areas 
   lacks.
 
 Firmyr
   Firmyr are a race of giant wolf-like creatures. Standing approximately ten
   feet tall and weighing about half a ton Firmyr posses tremendous strength 
   and constitution.  This raw power and savagery make Firmyr the ideal choice
   for a warrior. Other than this Firmyr society is very tribal leading them
   to be vary wary of magic's and arcane knowledge.

## CLASSES AND EQUIPMENT

-In the following descriptions the letters A-E will be used to reference the
 types of equipment a character may access. Here are the details of these  
 categories.

   Warriors are the fighters, barbarians and blades for hire that can be found
   in any realm. Warriors have access object classes A and B.
 
 Hunter
   Hunters are like warriors but fight for a preservation of nature. At later 
   levels they become in tune with the powers of nature and may use them to
   great avail. Hunters have to access object classes A, B and C.
 
 Avatar
   Avatars are the great heroes and heroines that are the pinnacle of chivalry
   and righteousness. At later levels they begin to inherit powers of divine
   origin much to the dismay of evil.  Avatars have access to object classes A,B,
   and D.
 
 Enchanter
   Enchanters are great masters of the arcane magic's. Spending many years 
   mastering the war magic's. Enchanters have access to object classes A and C.

   Acolytes wield magic's of divinity and protection.  Acolytes have access to
   object classes A and D.
 
 Seer
   Seers are individuals who have devoted themselves to complete magical 
   prowess. Gaining magic's from both the Acolyte and Enchanter realms but 
   never totally mastering either. Seers have access to object classes A, C, and
   D.
 
 Kensai
   Kensai are ancient weapons masters who have turned killing into an art. As
   a result of this specialization Kensai have access to weapons and armor of
   such great power that only a Kensai may wield them. But be warned, these
   weapons are of such great power that they may only be acquired by slaying 
   a high level monster. Kensai have access to object classes A,B, and E.
 
 Dark Lord
   Dark Lords can be referred to as the 'jack of all trades'. Dark Lords gain 
   minor powers in both the acolyte and enchanter realms, while remaining a 
   better fighter than either. Dark Lords also have access to ALL object 
   classes EXCEPT the Kensai artifacts.

## MODULE HISTORY
 
 Worlds of Darkness was developed between late 1994 and mid 1995 by Zark 
 Wizard and Alf, the tag team behind the GraphicWares/Wizard Software combined
 ISV. The game was never finished, but what is in the game is working and 
 playable. 
 
 GraphicWares and Wizard Software were acquired by Wilderland Software, which
 was then acquired by Elwynor Technologies in 2005.

 Elwynor Technologies ported the module to Worldgroup 3.2 in February 2021, but
 did not finish the missing pieces. As part of the Major BBS Restoration Project,
 a team asked to work on the module to finish it, which hopefully will happen
 in 2024-2025. See the devnotes folder for more information about the plans and
 status. We will track issues, requests, and ideas in github going forward.
 
 In 2025, prior to new features being added, the module was ported to The
 Major BBS v10 by Elwynor Technologies.

## COMPILATION

 This is a Worldgroup 3.2 / Major BBS v10 module. It's compiled using Borland
 C/C++ 5.0 for Worldgroup 3.2. If you have a working Worldgroup 3.2 development
 kit, a simple "make -f ELWWD" should do it! For Major BBS v10, import this
 project folder in the isv/ subtree of Visual Studio 2022, right click the
 project name and choose build! When ready to build for "release", ensure you
 are building for release.

## PACKING UP

 The DIST folder includes all of the items that should be packaged up in a 
 ELWWD.ZIP. When unzipped in a Worldgroup 3.2 or Major BBS V10 installation 
 folder, it "installs" the module.
