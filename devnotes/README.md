## What is in this folder?

As this game is unfinished, there are some notes and such that might help those of you interested in contributing.

Bugs.txt has some bugs that were noticed. We should move these to Issues in the git repo.
The rest include some notes from the devs, as well as a todo file.  We can create issues in the git repo for todos too.
